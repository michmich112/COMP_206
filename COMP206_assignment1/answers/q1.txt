Part a) When trying to catthe file, we are presented with the following error: "cat: answer.txt: Permission denied". Even if we try to edit it with a text editor (like vim by running: "vim answer.txt"), we get presented with a "permission denied" error.

Part b) To fix this proble, we first notice that all the persissions on the file "answer.txt" have been turned off (we see the following when we type ls -l: "---------- 1 user group 139 Sep 22 2015 answer.txt").
To correct this we type: "chmod u+r answer.txt" or "chmod 400 answer.txt" to give the user reading privileges.
